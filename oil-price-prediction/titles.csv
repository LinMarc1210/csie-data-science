"question our leaders: From Calin Rovinescu, former Air Canada CEO who sits on the boards of BCE and Scotiabank: Canada was built by people with a strong work ethic - including my own family, refugees from Romania - who believed in working hard to achieve good outcomes for themselves and their families. I am troubled that the various COVID-19 relief programs, while necessary at the start of the pandemic, are now disincentivizing employees from working. Employers from all sectors are ready to hire back staff and contribute to the economic recovery, but employees are not coming back. What will you do to help create employment and, more importantly, to enable business to grow and expand with confidence that labour will be available at world-competitive rates? From Wes Hall, founder of the BlackNorth Initiative, who also founded and is executive chair of Kingsdale Advisors: Systemic racism has been a part of the fabric of Canada since its founding as a nation, yet we are a country built on immigration, particularly immigrants of colour. Steps taken to address systemic racism to date have not worked. What concrete changes will you make to ensure that systemic racism is eradicated from our society? From Nancy Southern, chair and CEO of Calgary-based engineering and logistics company ATCO: The world has become more polarized in recent years, which is apparent throughout Europe and - closer to home - in the U.S. Here in Canada, we see a similar fracturing of our commonality and centrist approach. This is evident with the Quebec constitutional challenge, the lack of fulfillment on Truth and Reconciliation and the lack of support from Ottawa to develop Canada's natural resources - in forestry, ranching, oil and gas or mining - in any region. How do you plan to address nation building as Canada's future leader? How will you bridge the alienation and fragility in confederation that exists today while ensuring future prosperity for country?",07 Sep 2021

"Question our leaders: Question from Jay Hennick, chair and CEO of Colliers International: I was born in Canada to hard-working parents who instilled a strong work ethic and encouraged me to pursue a higher education, so that with a little luck, the rest would fall into place. These fundamentals allowed me to start and build two large Canadian-based public companies, FirstService Corporation and Colliers International. With this experience, I know what it takes to build world-class leadership teams and to compete and win on the global stage.

Yet, it is evident that our relationship with the largest member of the G7 and largest and most important trading partner, the U.S., is at an all-time low. What steps will you take to improve our relationship with the U.S. and work to influence Washington for the better?

University of Arizona president becomes the voice of moral clarity on Israel Arizona Republic There are not many more powerful testaments to the miracle of education than Robert C.

That is, if you don‘t count the 14 mass shootings since then in which 17 people were killed in North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Maryland, New Mexico, Kansas, Indiana and Florida. PRESS RELEASES Lawmakers Call out Governor‘s One-Sided Task Force on K-12 Facilities STATE CAPITOL, PHOENIX State Representative Beverly Pingerelli, Chairwoman of the House Committee on Education, and other lawmakers are speaking out today against Governor Hobbs‘ one-sided new task force on school facility standards which lacks representation from key stakeholders. The omission of Arizona‘s citizens, lawmakers, school board members, parents, and taxpayers is a glaring oversight in public policy. The committee is primarily comprised of a narrow collection of lobbyists and district staff with a single agenda: increased spending. Notably, the teacher's union is included, while taxpayers, parents, and lawmakers are excluded. Industry representatives focused solely on school and public construction are present, rather than independent experts. We remind the Governor that real leadership requires all stakeholders in the room working on tough issues, not a one-sided committee where the conclusion is complete before it begins, said Chairwoman Pingerelli. Leaving out lawmakers, parents, and taxpayers ignores vital concerns. It certainly calls into question the ability of the State Legislature to support the effort if the changes adopted by the committee are unreasonable. When the Governor creates committees like these, she‘s missing out on the diversity that is vital to ensuring that productive solutions can be reached, said Senator Ken Bennett (R-1), Chairman of the Senate Education Committee. If you want to hold school buildings to higher standards, you need a voice from the people who are directly impacted by them, as well as experts who don‘t personally benefit from being on the committee. We all want better schools, and to do so, we need lawmakers and community members involved in these discussions and decisions. Our school districts must compete with a variety of providers in the 21st century and we cannot box them in with 20th century-thinking that every school needs to be the same, said Representative Michael Carbone (R-25). Instead of finding ways to mandate more spending on capital, our schools should be focused on flexible models and increased spending in the classroom. ### Arizona State Parks & Trails Offers Free Entrance to Veterans on Veterans Day PHOENIX Veterans, active duty military, and National Guard members are invited to enjoy a fee-free day at any Arizona state park this Veterans Day, Saturday, November 11, 2023.

Arizona is becoming a battery manufacturing powerhouse, according to the latest report from Climate Power. New clean energy projects have already spurred $10.01 billion in investments and helped create or move forward over 13,570 good-paying clean energy jobs in the state. Arizona highlights: KORE Power CEO Lindsay Gorrill applauded the IRA‘s passage and said it provides an incredible lift to his company‘s 1.3 million square foot battery manufacturing development in Buckeye. The U.S. Department of Energy‘s Loan Programs Office has conditionally approved a loan for the facility‘s construction, which will create 700 construction jobs. The battery facility is expected to employ 1,250 when fully operational. At a recent groundbreaking for American Battery Factory‘s 2 million-square-foot gigafactory in Tucson, where an estimated 1,000 jobs are being created, Tucson Mayor Regina Romero proclaimed: ""Cities like Tucson are leading on EV readiness and climate action. Many years from now, when we look back at the global race to develop the clean technologies of the future, people will look to the Sonoran Desert."" Arizona ranks second in the nation for solar energy potential, and the industry is ramping up in the state. After acquiring Sun Streams 3 from First Solar in February 2021, Longroad Energy completed financing for a Maricopa County project in January 2023. Longroad's CEO said he believes the IRA will enable future developments and benefit utilities and ratepayers. ""The renaissance in American manufacturing is offering opportunities to workers across the country to play a part in building the nation‘s clean energy economy,"" said Lindsay Gorrill, CEO and Founder of KORE Power. ""From our team in Vermont that is advancing innovative energy storage solutions, to the construction crews building the KOREPlex in Arizona, we are proud of the men and women whose work is delivering on the promise of the clean energy transition."" President Biden and Congressional Democrats‘ clean energy plan is bringing good paying manufacturing jobs back to communities across America uplifting local economies and lowering energy costs, all while lowering toxic emissions, said Lori Lodes, Climate Power‘s Executive Director. In small towns, big cities, and everywhere in between, Americans across the country are benefitting from our surging clean energy economy. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act at least 25 times, even though the clean energy boom benefits their communities the most. The contrast between President Biden and House MAGA Republicans couldn‘t be any clearer. President Biden‘s clean energy plan is working, and it‘s setting off America‘s next economic boom, said Gina McCarthy, Managing Co-Chair of America is All In. American workers and businesses are mobilizing to build the clean energy economy, showing that in every corner of our country, growing the economy goes hand-in-hand with tackling the climate crisis. This isn‘t some far-off dream. We‘re building the economy of the future right here in America: one that's healthier, cleaner, and more just."" National highlights: Clean energy businesses have announced or moved forward with more than 200,000 jobs across 45 states and Puerto Rico. The report details 388 clean energy projects, totaling $310 billion in new investments. Since Climate Power‘s last report, businesses have added or announced 40,000 new jobs, totaling $31.62 billion in investments. This report is Climate Power‘s first to break down the clean energy boom in rural communities, which are benefiting from significant clean energy investments. Since August of 2022, 70 new projects are located in rural communities, totaling $35.59 billion in new investments and 33,578 new clean energy jobs. Thanks to the clean energy plan, businesses have the security and stability they need to break ground on new facilities, creating good-paying jobs in the process. Climate Power‘s reports consistently find that a majority of the nation‘s clean energy project growth has occurred in districts represented by Republicans. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, 120,573 new jobs and over $242 billion in investments across 200 clean energy projects are in 109 districts represented by House Republicans. ### $13M NIH grant funds research aimed at revitalizing immune systems of older adults TUCSON, Arizona University of Arizona Health Sciences researchers received a $13.1 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to continue studies aimed at rejuvenating the immune system of older people in order to improve health throughout the lifespan. Older adults are disproportionally affected by infection, cancer and certain types of autoimmune disease. This is influenced by the fact that as a person ages, their body produces fewer T cells and gets less proficient at maintaining them. T cells are a type of white blood cell essential to the immune system and defense against infection. It is clear how much our immune system declines with age when you look at all the previous epidemics and pandemics that have hit us, including COVID-19. Older adults die at a rate somewhere between 50 to 300 times more frequently than people in the younger age groups, said principal investigator Janko Nikolich, MD, PhD, professor and head of the Department of Immunobiology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine Tucson. We are looking at the thymus gland, which develops T cells, and at the lymph nodes, which maintain them, and examining how we can combat the erosion of age by jumpstarting them. The goal of the National Institutes of Health-funded research is to contribute to the fundamental knowledge of T cell aging and create interventions to improve immune defense. The program consists of three research studies and four supporting cores that span multiple sites across the country. This program is a great example of integrated and coordinated team science. We exchange our ideas and findings and troubleshoot each other‘s experiments, said Nikolich, who leads two UArizona Health Sciences strategic initiatives: Personalized Defense and the Aegis Consortium. Everyone is working on their separate projects, but each project benefits from what we all discover. The first project, Response of aged thymus to injury and rejuvenation signals, is led by Jarrod Dudakov, PhD, associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and affiliate associate professor at the University of Washington. The research team hopes to increase their understanding of how the thymus responds to injury and repairs itself. The thymus gland has a remarkable capacity for bouncing back from acute injury caused by infection, shock or chemotherapy, but this ability deteriorates with age. The project will focus on enhancing thymic regeneration in older individuals, which could result in clinical approaches to enhance the immune system. The second project, Role of the microenvironment in regulating early stages of thymic involution and central tolerance, is led by Lauren Ehrlich, PhD, professor of molecular biosciences and oncology at the University of Texas at Austin. It will examine how the cellular composition of the thymus changes with age, which could impact the quantity and quality of developing T cells. The third project, Peripheral T cell maintenance defects with aging, focuses on how aging affects the lymph nodes. It is part of Nikolich‘s continuing studies of how the decline in naive T cells impacts the immune system. Naive T cells are produced in the thymus but need additional support from the lymph nodes to function effectively. Our previous research has shown that defects in the lymph nodes can powerfully undermine the benefits of reawakening T cell production in the thymus, said Nikolich, who is a member of the university‘s BIO5 Institute. So, even if we can generate a plethora of high-quality T cells, if the lymph nodes are impaired, those T cells will be clueless. They will not be able to quickly react and respond to infection. The first signs of age-related vulnerability to infection start between the ages of 40 and 50. More drastic declines in the immune systems are seen in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Nikolich says interventions to improve T cells and the immune system could greatly benefit the quality of life for older people and provide substantial economic relief for health care expenses. ### Art Program in Detention Allows Youth to Express Difficult Emotions PHOENIX (November 1, 2023) Using a paintbrush and diving into their creativity, youth in the Maricopa County Juvenile Detention Center are transforming a blank canvas into healing art. The Juvenile Probation Department, part of the Judicial Branch of Arizona in Maricopa County, started a collaboration with Young Arts Arizona in 2002 and since has empowered thousands of youths to achieve their full potential through artistic expression. This 21-year partnership with Young Arts has been a highlight for the Juvenile Court and Detention, said Deputy Juvenile Court Administrator Derrick Platt. When it first started, we had art teachers come into detention and do art sessions. It slowly transitioned to detention staff facilitating and having main themes. The themes were based around healing and sharing. This is a great way that detention youth give back to beautifying their community and working through their trauma. Twice a year, a Young Arts Arizona teaching artist instructs detention center staff in various forms of art-making with a variety of materials. Then detention staff facilitate art workshops on an ongoing basis with kids in detention. Juveniles are learning about the power of self-awareness and our artistic youth are not only given the opportunity to hone in on their art skills but also learn about networking, time-management, and profitability, said Juvenile Detention Officer Yaneth Marchena. When the day comes, they are prepared, with sketches in hand. The youth are quick to mention how happy they are to get off their units and work on their craft. Additionally, they are ecstatic when they learn a new technique. Most importantly, I‘ve heard youth participating in these workshops quote our guests to other youth in the facility. It‘s rewarding to hear that our youth are learning from these workshops and feel so confident about what they learned that they share it with others. The Young Arts Program serves about 200 kids in detention annually. Over the 21 years the program has been in operation, it is estimated to have served over 4,000 youth in Maricopa County. Our teaching artists are deeply compassionate to the children‘s circumstances. They are dedicated to helping children release their creative spirit and express themselves through art, said Young Arts Arizona Deputy Director Alicia Keenon. It serves as an antidote to a life full of challenges and stress. In the detention centers, staff facilitate the art-making process, and that method has proven very successful throughout the years. Youth participants proudly work on their artwork anticipating forming part of a public exhibition created by their peers. Once the art projects are completed, a Young Arts curator selects the art pieces for exhibition and frames them. The installations rotate through 15 galleries and are seen by over 200,000 people. The galleries are not only located in Maricopa County Juvenile Court but in buildings in the Pima County Juvenile Court, Young Arts‘ Papp Gallery, Arizona Opera, Revzen Atrium, Arizona State Education Board Room, Read on Arizona and Phoenix Little Theater. Making art has a healing and rehabilitative effect for these children. They can see themselves positively as creators and exhibitors of art and not only as product of their circumstances, said Keenon. This program is called the Art of Inner Freedom, which indicates that though the kids are momentarily detained, the hope is they will find their internal and external freedom through the healing properties of artistic expression. ### TENANTS, HOUSING ACTIVISTS CALL ON BIDEN TO STOP BUDGET CUTS TO DEPT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (HUD) WASHINGTON D.C Today ahead of the senate vote on transportation, housing and urban development, hundred of renters gathered with housing activists to call on President Biden and congress to stop the regressive cuts to the US Department of Housing and Development (HUD) and advocate for an office of social housing to end our worsening national housing crisis. Our national housing crisis demands a response from congress that centers working people and people of color. Republican leaders‘ proposed budget cuts, from slashing affordable housing and food assistance to education and environmental protection, threaten decades of harm to our communities, and particularly low-income communities of color that are already struggling to afford housing. Evictions are on the rise nationally. Our communities can‘t wait for solutions. Congress and President Biden must act to stop cuts to the Department of Housing and Development, said Center for Popular Democracy Co-Executive Director, Analillia Mejia, We demand visionary and massive federal funding for green social housing to solve our nation‘s housing crisis while responding to the global climate crisis. HUD is not just a government agency, it is a lifeline for seniors like me who depend on affordable housing, safe communities, and supportive services. It is a beacon of hope for working class families, said Sharon Littlejohn from CASA. We cannot we must not turn our backs on the vulnerable, the elderly, and the poor. It is not about numbers or budget, it is about the heart and soul of our nation. Budgets are moral documents and the proposal for HUD cutsare immoral, said Thomas Silverstein from Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law. A person that is formerly incarcerated doesn‘t have the same opportunitiesthey don‘t get the opportunity to have safe housing because of their conviction. said Akesia Lee from Step Up Louisiana ### Gallego, McCaul Push for Increased Funding for Immigration-Impacted First Responders in FY24 Supplemental WASHINGTON, D.C. Reps. Ruben Gallego (AZ-03) and Michael McCaul (TX-10) today sent a letter to House Appropriations Committee leadership requesting that any Fiscal Year 2024 supplemental appropriations include funding for critical programs to aid first responders in communities impacted by immigration. The members write: Local police departments are barred from directly enforcing immigration laws. However, first responders, particularly local law enforcement, are fielding significantly more calls, including for organized criminal activity, loitering, trespassing, and emergency response. Even without violent criminal conduct, every call to a police department, fire department, or EOC increases the strain on resources and personnel that makes it harder for them to help taxpaying permanent residents. As the members note, the southwestern border has seen a dramatic increase in crossings in recent months. In September alone, the Department of Homeland Security recorded over 269,000 crossings, which brought the total for the year up to 2.4 million crossingsthe highest number on record. The members state that the increased operations are stretching the resources of local governments, police, and fire departments to the limit. Without additional funding, many local leaders and decision-makers face a choice provide only vital services to long-term residents and ignore certain emergency calls they determine to not be top priority or devote resources towards responding to a ballooning migrant population with no end in sight. The letter from Reps. Gallego and McCaul echo the concerns raised in an October 10 letter sent by the Arizona Sheriffs‘ Association. The Sheriffs note that historic short comings by the federal government to assist local agencies means the financial and human costs fall to the states and specifically Arizona, and that by making a small investment, Arizona will at least make a dent while improving the safety of our local communities. Gallego and McCaul conclude the letter underscoring just how critical the dollars would be to southwestern border communities. This funding is critical to providing state and local agencies with the resources they need to hire more police officers, firefighters, and emergency responders, as much-needed equipment and overtime pay for first responders who are already on the frontlines of this crisis, they write. Rep. Gallego previously secured $2,263,885 in emergency funding from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to support Arizona‘s border communities as they address an increase in migrant crossings. Gallego also sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell earlier this year urging the Agency to fix a new documentation requirement that strains border communities and non-profits in Arizona, putting their funding at risk. It was his third letter regarding issues with the Shelter and Services Program (SSP). In June, he sent a first letter to FEMA arguing that border states like Arizona need more funding to address border crossings and provide services. He called the FEMA funding model misguided. After a lackluster response from FEMA, he sent a second letter to Sec. Mayorkas directly, expressing his disagreement with the funding model. Following the end of Title 42 and communications with Arizona border leaders, Gallego sent four letters to Biden Administration officials and Congress requesting specific resources these communities need to reduce the burden on them and their residents. ### Sinema, Arizona National Guard Adjutant General Discuss Military Priorities Sinema Secured in Annual Defense Legislation WASHINGTON Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema met with Major General Kerry Muehlenbeck, the Adjutant General of the Arizona National Guard, to discuss steps she‘s taking to advance Arizona‘s top military priorities. Meeting with Arizona military commanders informs our work to deliver resources and missions to Arizona ensuring our state continues being a leader in our national defense, said Sinema. Sinema worked to secure multiple Arizona military priorities in the annual bipartisan defense legislation including raising servicemember pay to support military families, critical infrastructure upgrades to military installations across Arizona, and more. The annual defense legislation additionally requires a plan requested by Sinema for modernizing Air National Guard fighter force structure in order to provide long-term planning for Air Force airpower and fighter squadrons like the 162nd Wing which flies F-16s in Tucson; provides $15 million for the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Surprise; provides $12 million for Army Reserve Area Maintenance Support Activity facility in Queen Creek; and provides $11.6 million for the Air National Guard to construct emergency defense infrastructure at the Tucson International Airport. Major General Kerry Muehlenbeck is the Adjutant General of Arizona and Director of the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs, responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of Arizona‘s Army and Air National Guard, Joint Programs, and the Division of Emergency Management. She leads an 8,300- member department, of which 2,400 are full-time federal military and civilian personnel, and 600 are full-time state employees. ### Republican Governors Call on President Biden to Reconsider the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services‘ Unrealistic Long-Term Care Staffing Requirements WASHINGTON, D.C. Today, 15 Republican governors, led by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen, sent a letter to President Biden calling on him to reconsider Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services‘ (CMS) onerous proposed long-term care staffing requirements. The letter directs President Biden to reconsider CMS's proposed one-size-fits-all long-term care staffing requirements rule that will force many long-term care facilities to close and erode health care access for some of the nation‘s most vulnerable citizens. Further, the letter states that President Biden‘s proposed rule disregards results from CMS‘s own study on long-term care facility staffing and puts citizens further at risk. Republican governors are committed to protecting the health and safety of all citizens and welcome the Biden Administration to join a genuine state-federal dialogue on how to best serve long-term care residents. Read the full letter here. Led by Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen, additional signatories include: Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, Missouri Governor Mike Parson, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte, Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, and Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon. ### Arizona Democrats Statement on Anthony Kern Entering AZ-08 Primary ARIZONA- Two days ago, State Senator and Insurrectionist Anthony Kern announced that he was entering the messy MAGA primary for Congresswoman Debbie Lesko‘s Congressional seat (AZ-08). Moments after Kern‘s announcement, reporting from the Arizona Mirror exposed a complaint from the Arizona Secretary of State‘s Office that Kern illegally used campaign funds to attend the insurrection. Chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party, Yolanda Bejarano and Debrah Howard, candidate for State Senate in LD27 released the following statements. Insurrectionist Anthony Kern is one of the most extreme members of the Arizona Republican Party, "" said Chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party Yolanda Bejarano. From attending the January 6th insurrection with campaign funds to misrepresenting himself as a police officer, Kern is a threat to democracy and the rule of law. The primary for AZ-08 is shaping out to be a battle of who can be the most MAGA, and whoever wins the primary will have to answer for their extremism in the general. The voters in Legislative District 27 know the real Anthony Kern, and they have had enough. Anthony Kern, Kevin Payne and Ben Toma have been consistently out of step with voters' priorities in favor of extremism, said Deborah Howard, candidate for the State Senate in LD27. At the legislature, Kern and his colleagues disregarded the will of the voters countless times, and it's time for a new majority. Who is Anthony Kern? Anthony Kern is an insurrectionist. Footage from January 6th shows Kern along the West Front area of the Capitol. Kern tweeted about January 6th, 17 times before the insurrection and the day he tweeted out D-Day in DC to support Arizona‘s and America‘s duly elected President Donald Trump! #StoptheSteal, around 10 a.m. with a picture of the stage where Trump would soon speak. Anthony Kern is a liar. Kern was fired from the El Mirage Police Department in 2014 after lying to his supervisor, and was placed on a list of Maricopa County law enforcement officials with a history of dishonesty or misconduct. In the legislature Kern then tried to pass a bill that would get him and others on the Brady list removed. Anthony Kern is a fake elector. Kern was one of the eleven Arizona Republicans who signed a document representing a nonexistent organization, We are the electors who represent the legal voters of Arizona. ### Partnership with TheDream.US will provide scholarships to undocumented students at UArizona TUCSON, Ariz. A new partnership with TheDream.US, a national college access and success program for immigrant youth, will provide scholarships to Arizona's undocumented students who wish to attend the University of Arizona. TheDream.US today opened its new round of scholarship applications for its National Scholarship for the 2024-25 academic year. The deadline is Feb. 29, 2024. The scholarship provides up to $33,000 for a bachelor's degree. Some scholars may also receive a stipend for books, supplies and transportation. The funding aims to fill the gap between the total cost of tuition and fees and any scholarships and financial aid the student has already received. ""This new partnership with TheDream.US is a crucial step in our effort to make sure that all of Arizona's youth have the opportunity to attend college and achieve their higher education goals,"" said University of Arizona President Robert C. Robbins. ""I am proud that the university, as Arizona's land-grant institution, has entered this partnership, which allows us to serve more incoming students, including Arizona's Dreamers."" The program is open to undocumented prospective students who arrived in the United States before Nov. 1, 2018, and before they turned 16 years old. Applicants must also have protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy or temporary protected status from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. These students are commonly referred to as Dreamers. Applicants must also be eligible for in-state tuition to be eligible for the scholarship. Arizona voters in 2022 passed Proposition 308, which granted in-state tuition for qualifying, non-citizen Arizona high school graduates. Other eligibility criteria include: Demonstrating significant unmet financial need. Graduating or planning to graduate from a U.S. high school by the fall of 2024. Holding a high school GPA of 2.5 or better on a 4.0 scale or having a cumulative college GPA of 2.5 or better. Enrolling full time in a bachelor's degree program in the fall of 2024. ""We are thrilled to launch our partnership with TheDream.US,"" said Kasey Urqudez, UArizona vice president for enrollment management and dean of undergraduate admissions. ""This is the realization of a long-held ambition for the University of Arizona. We look forward to empowering and supporting Arizona Dreamers as they pursue their academic aspirations and pave a way to their futures full of success."" TheDream.US will select successful applicants and decide scholarship amounts. The program is expected to notify successful applicants in April. Those who are not yet admitted to UArizona for fall 2024 should also apply for admission to the university and should do so before applying for the TheDream.US scholarship, said Rafael Meza, senior director of enrollment management and assistant dean of undergraduate admissions. Upon admission, students learn if they are eligible for the university's resident merit-aid awards. ""This will give them a picture of what they're getting from us, and then what they can potentially get from TheDream.US,"" Meza said. As with all prospective students, staff in Enrollment Management will reach out directly to applicants to guide them through the university's admission process while their TheDream.US application is under review. Several university leaders and staff have been designated to support TheDream.US scholarship recipients. In addition to Urqudez and Meza, they are: Aaron Barnes, director of Counseling and Psych Services Karla Cruze-Silva, associate director of Hispanic-Serving Institution initiatives Jessica Martinez, coordinator of immigrant student support at the Thrive Center Marbila Rocha, manager of career events in Student Engagement and Career Services Art Young, assistant vice president of Enrollment Management and executive director of Scholarships and Financial Aid The scholarships offered by TheDream.US will add to existing scholarship programs and resources the university already offers to immigrant students, primarily through the Thrive Center. Those include the President's Directed Scholarship Fund, which provides scholarships to current and incoming students who are protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. Students can also find scholarships through Immigrants Rising, a San Francisco-based organization that helps connect undocumented people with educational and career resources. Scholarship Universe, the university's scholarship searching and matching tool for admitted UArizona students, also helps connect students to millions of dollars in internal and external scholarships. ### Gallego, Bacon Urge State and Treasury Stop Illicit Iranian Oil Exports to China WASHINGTON, DC Reps. Ruben Gallego (AZ-03) and Don Bacon (NE-02) called on Secretary of State Antony Blinked and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a letter to use the tools of the federal government at its disposal to stem the flow of illicit Iranian oil sales to China to halt Iran‘s financing, arming, and training of terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah. These increasingly sophisticated exports from Iran to China are helping fuel Iran‘s malign influence throughout the region, funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah in the process, the members write. As the letter states, Iran sends China an estimated 1.5 million barrels a day of crude oil, largely through smaller, semi-private refiners in Shandong known as teapots. This helps obscure the role of the Chinese government in illicit oil purchases from Iran and shield larger Chinese firms and the Chinese Communist Party from exposure to the U.S. financial system and associated sanctions. That‘s why Reps. Gallego and Bacon requested Secs. Blinken and Yellen answer the following questions: 1. What is the administration‘s plan to stem the flow of illicit Iranian oil sales to China? 2. How is the administration preparing for an expected rise in oil prices resulting from instability in the Middle East? 3. How will the U.S. counter the economic benefits buyers might derive from buying discounted Iranian oil? 4. Is the administration planning to increase interdiction of illicit Iranian exports? 5. What steps are the administration taking to deter Iran from attacks against Western shipping? 6. What, if any new sanctions are the administration planning to put in place on Iran? Iran‘s evasion of sanctions constitutes a clear and present danger not only to our allies, but to America‘s forward operating forces in the Middle East. It is therefore critical that we do everything in our power to stop the financing of Iranian-backed terrorism, the members conclude in the letter. Rep. Gallego previously called for the freezing of Iranian assets, including the $6 billion that was recently unfrozen in a prisoner swap, and joined Rep. Mike Gallagher (WI-08) in a letter calling for the Biden Administration to take specific actions on Iranian assets. ### In First Senate Appropriations Hearing, Sinema Calls for Resources to Support Israel and Combat Rising Anti-Freedom, Anti-Democratic Forces Around the World WASHINGTON In her first hearing as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Arizona senior Senator Kyrsten Sinema questioned U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin about the need to pass a bipartisan national security package supporting Israel, helping Ukraine beat Putin, and securing Arizona‘s border. Noting the bipartisan accomplishments she‘s achieved with Appropriations Committee Chair Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Vice Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sinema reaffirmed her steadfast commitment to furthering the committee‘s critical bipartisan work beginning with a robust supplemental including resources for Israel, Ukraine, and Arizona‘s border. America‘s adversaries are watching how we act and react, while actors across the globe that stand against everything we as Americans believe in actively try to destabilize and destroy democracies. Congress must pass legislation to support Israel, beat Putin, and secure Arizona‘s border. These three are all urgent concerns and should advance together as they are critical for both my state and our country‘s national security, said Sinema, a new member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary Austin testified in support of the supplemental funding request. The supplemental request is roughly $105 billion including $61.4 billion to support Ukraine, $14.3 billion to support Israel, $14 billion to deliver much-needed resources to the Southern border, $7.4 billion to counter China‘s influence in the Indo-Pacific, and another $9.15 billion for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza. During the hearing, Sinema questioned Secretary Austin about the impact and importance of the funding in the supplemental request. The Senator underscored the need to ensure support is strategic and targeted with proper oversight to make certain that it goes to the people and places that need them most. Sinema recently introduced the bipartisan Revoke Iranian Funding Act which freezes $6 billion in Iranian assets held in Qatar. Sinema‘s bipartisan legislation prevents the Iranian regime one of Hamas‘s largest supporters from accessing and using the funds currently held in Qatar to finance terrorist attacks against Israel or any other nation. The bill also directs the U.S. Treasury Secretary to study all high-value Iranian assets around the world currently blocked by U.S. sanctions and report these findings to Congress that way Sinema and her colleagues have the information needed to enact further targeted legislation if necessary. Following the terrorist attacks against Israel, Sinema urged President Biden to quickly transfer requested defense weapons to Israel as it defends itself against terrorism. ### Maricopa County Receives Grant from Governor‘s Office for Accelerated Career Training in Rural Communities Phoenix, Ariz. (Nov. 1, 2023) More than 90 people are expected to benefit from the first year of a new program that brings accelerated career training opportunities to rural areas of Maricopa County. Approved by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors at its Nov. 1 meeting, the program, called Workforce 2 You, will be available to career seekers in Gila Bend, Queen Creek, and Wickenburg. The Workforce 2 You program is a direct response to address inequities surrounding access to training programs in rural communities, said Board of Supervisors Chairman Clint Hickman of District 4. By offering this training, we are removing distance and cost barriers that have prevented so many of our residents from leveraging career coaching, credentials, and services that can support their success. Funded through a $500,000 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Grant provided by the Governor‘s Office, the one-year pilot program will target youth, dislocated workers, veterans, and other populations most in need of workforce services. The training programs will be offered in a variety of high-demand industries, including: Construction Healthcare Information Technology Manufacturing Transportation Participants will be enrolled in accelerated training programs lasting between 4 and 12 weeks that provide opportunities to earn industry-recognized credentials. The program also opens the door for participants to benefit from assistance with tuition, childcare, and transportation as well as other wraparound services provided by Maricopa County‘s Human Services Department during their training and for up to 12 months after program completion. For more information on this and other services offered by Maricopa County‘s Human Services Department, visit Maricopa.gov/HSDConnect. ### FORMER TEACHER CONVICTED ON 14 COUNTS OF SEXUAL ABUSE (Phoenix) Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell announced today that a jury has found Manuel Gavina (08/70) guilty of sexually abusing 14 girls all under the age of 16. The crimes occurred during math classes at Capitol Elementary School in Central Phoenix when Gavina would touch the children‘s breasts. This man is the definition of a sexual predator, said County Attorney Mitchell. Teachers are trusted adults in our community. Any child in any classroom in this county should feel safe at school, yet this man violated that childhood peace. I will not stand for these types of attacks on our kids. I‘m proud of my team of prosecutors who proved his guilt and have taken the first step toward ensuring he is removed from our community before he does any more of this kind of horrific damage. Some of Gavina‘s victims first came forward in 2017. Phoenix Police were first notified of the accusations against Gavina in December 2019, when more victims came forward. Each count of sexual abuse is a dangerous crime against children, a Class III felony. The defendant could face anywhere from 17.5 to 70 years in prison. Sentencing for Manuel Gavina is set for November 30, 2023. ### Mayor Gallego to Celebrate Voluntary Water Conservation Agreement with Bureau of Reclamation On Friday, November 3, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego will welcome Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, as well as Tribal, state and local officials to Phoenix City Hall to celebrate funding for water conservation in Arizona. In May, the Phoenix City Council unanimously approved a significant commitment to regional water conservation efforts by agreeing to a landmark initiative in partnership with the United States Bureau of Reclamation, the Arizona Department of Water Resources, and Central Arizona Project. In the face of severe drought conditions and historically low water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, this agreement aims to preserve the Colorado River, a critical water source for Phoenix and the Western United States. Under this agreement, the City of Phoenix will voluntarily forgo up to 50,000 acre-feet of its Colorado River entitlement each year from 2023 to 2025. Authorized under the Lower Colorado River Basin System Conservation and Efficiency Program and funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, the agreements incentivize the voluntary conservation of Colorado River water. Under Gallego‘s leadership, Phoenix continues to develop collaborative, intergovernmental action to conserve our most precious resource. Working with tribes, cities, and other entities across the state and the region, Phoenix remains committed to ongoing conservation and efficiency improvements. In April, Gallego announced the city‘s ambitious plan to develop an Advanced Water Purification Facility that would provide clean, drinkable water to 200,000 households per year by 2030. This summer, the Phoenix City Council also approved the Sustainable Desert Development Policy that Gallego had been leading on since early in 2022, which includes regulations on non-functional turf, a mandate to meet EPA WaterSense or similar certification, planting of drought-tolerant and native plants, outdoor irrigation standards, enhanced standards for swimming pools, and more.
